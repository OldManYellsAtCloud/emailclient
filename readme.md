This is a very early version of an email client, using IMAP protocol.

It is barely does anything, and if you have found this project by any chance, you should not use it.

Currently it fetches and syncs folder content sucessfully, but that's only the backend. I primarily want it to be a very lightweight mail-reading application, which it supposed to reach any moment... but then it won't get a lot of new features (most probably).
